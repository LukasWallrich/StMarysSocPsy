## Preparation before class



## Recommended readings

* Textbook: Chapters 

* Further (non-academic) reading: *Humankind* by Rutger Bregman is a beautiful book that draws on social psychology and related disciplines to argue that humans are fundamentally good. It provides a novel perspective on many 'landmark' research findings and offers hope in these troubled times.
