# Social influence: behaviour in groups

We spend much of our lives in groups - be they groups of friends hanging out, teams trying to 
achieve a common purpose or protestors working to bring about change. Often, our individual
behaviour is powerfully shaped by the presence of others. This week, we will explore when 
that happens, and how groups can enhance rather than impede both performance and moral behaviour.
