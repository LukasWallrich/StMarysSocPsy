I am keeping it here rather than on Moodle so that I can keep it open (see Open Teaching Materials). It is a living document and will grow over time - feel free to raise any issues and suggestions here and bring questions to the live sessions. 0.1 Live sessions We will meet on Zoom every Thursday morning from October 1 to December 10, with the exception of November 5. Check MyModules here for the exact times and Zoom links. 0.2 Collaborative group summary I highly encourage you to contribute to a collaborative group summary of the module. This will give you a good resource for revision, make note taking more effective and allow you to easily ask questions to me and to your peers. Click here to see the document and to contribute. 0.3 Further sources This guide does not aim to be comprehensive, but just to provide sufficient orientation. To succeed, you will need to use a range of other resources as well. 0.3.1 MyModules (Moodle) Some copyrighted materials are only available on MyModules. You can also find all submissions links for the assignments there. 0.3.2 Textbooks Given the current situation, I will mostly refer to a good recent textbook that is freely available online: Principles of Social Psychology. You can also download it as a PDF file if you prefer that. There will be one or two chapters that are required reading for each week. Other textbooks for Social Psychology will cover most of the content as well, so you are welcome to use those for additional reading. An Introduction to Social Psychology, edited by Wolfgang Stroebe and Miles Hewstone, is good, and used copies of earlier editions can be found quite cheaply on Amazon at the moment The book “Social Psychology: Revisiting the classic studies” offers a very helpful look at the most famous and influential studies that you might have encountered already. There are two copies in the library. At the moment, you can also find an online copy here 0.3.3 Reading list Each weekly section in this guide will start with a set of recommended readings. You do not need to read every word of them, but make sure to read the key parts (e.g., abstracts, summaries, discussion sections), so that you can choose where to go further and remember where to find information when it comes to the assignments. 0.3.4 Independent reading When it comes to the assignment, you will have to show that you read independently - however, even earlier, it can be fun to explore interesting things further. To find readings, you can use the St Mary’s library catalogue should be your first point of call and links to many online resources Google Scholar is a great search engine to find academic articles. If you want to use it regularly, link it to your St Mary’s account as that will make it much easier to get access to articles behind paywalls. Go to Google Scholar Library Links and search for St Mary’s - the correct result is called “St Mary’s University - Full-text @ St Mary’s” 0.4 A note on open teaching materials Why keep materials here rather than on Moodle? Basically, because I like transparency and dislike any kinds of paywalls in science. Open Access to journal articles without having to pay for an expensive subscription has been one of the key demands of the Open Science movement, and we are slowly getting there. Open access to teaching materials is a next step, and this is one of my small contributions to that movement. "],
["getting-started-with-social-psychology.html", "Lecture 1 Getting started with Social Psychology 1.1 Video lecture for this week 1.2 Preparation before class 1.3 Recommended readings", " Lecture 1 Getting started with Social Psychology Humans have been described as ‘social animals’ - it can plausibly be argued that our ability to cooperate in social groups is what sets us apart from our otherwise close animal relatives. This can obviously result in prosperity and beautiful cultural creations, but also in mass violence and destruction. Social psychology attempts to understand how individuals behave in groups, and thus what the conditions are for positive and negative outcomes to arise. 1.1 Video lecture for this week Here the lecture for this week. I would encourage you to also have the slides open when you watch it, so that you can easily pause and reread the slides when I go too fast. Also, please take note of all your questions, so that we can address them in class. You can download the slides here 1.2 Preparation before class Watch the video and note down key points and questions Read Chapter 1 in the textbook (link below) 1.3 Recommended readings Textbook: Chapter 1 and Chapter 4 in Principles of Social Psychology Further (non-academic) reading: Humankind (Bregman 2020) is a beautiful book that draws on social psychology and related disciplines to argue that humans are fundamentally good. It provides a novel perspective on many ‘landmark’ research findings and offers hope in these troubled times. At the moment, you can find an online copy here; chapters 1 and 2 give a good overview of the book and intro to some ideas in this course. "],
["prejudice-and-intergroup-conflict.html", "Lecture 2 Prejudice and intergroup conflict 2.1 Video lecture for this week 2.2 Recommended readings 2.3 Additions after the live session", " Lecture 2 Prejudice and intergroup conflict Understanding intergroup conflict has been a priority from the start of social psychology, in the aftermath of World War II. This week, we are exploring how prejudice emerges, how it shapes relationships between groups on many levels and it can be reduced. 2.1 Video lecture for this week This week’s lecture is split into four parts, that you should watch in order. In between, there are a couple of questions that will allow you to reflect on the content and make sure you have understood the main points. You can download the lecture slides here 2.1.1 Emergence of prejudice Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions: According to Social Identity Theory, how do we most want to view groups that we belong to: fair and welcoming positively distinct dominant and powerful Match the following concepts to affect, behaviour and cognition: prejudice: affect behaviour cognition stereotypes: affect behaviour cognition discrimination: affect behaviour cognition What is the availability heuristic? Think about the answer before viewing it. View answer The tendency to use availability - the ease with which one can bring to mind exemplars of an event - as a way to estimate the probability or frequency of that event. 2.1.2 Maintaining false beliefs According to Leon Festinger, what mental state do we want to avoid? What type of information do people generally seek out most? Information that allows them to test and develop their beliefs confirms their belief has the highest quality Test your estimates of immigration to your local area in the UK (note that the numbers are from 2014, but you can still see if you are way off) View test 2.1.3 Impact of prejudice and stereotypes Optional: take an Implicit Association Test to learn more about your personal views and to see how implicit bias is measured: Project Implicit 2.1.4 Reducing prejudice and promoting inclusion Can you think of any personal examples where some kind of intergroup contact changed your attitudes? If so, how did that change come about? True or false: telling people to ignore group memberships in evaluating individuals (i.e. to be ‘colour-blind’) leads to better intergroup outcomes than promoting multiculturalism. TRUE FALSE What is a meta-analysis? Think about the answer before viewing it. View answer A study that collects all research (ideally published and unpublished) on a given topic and then statistically combines their results. This gives us the best evidence whether there really is an effect and how strong the effect is likely to be, because random error and variation across studies should cancel out. 2.2 Recommended readings Textbook: Chapter 12 in Principles of Social Psychology Chapter 9 in Social Psychology: Revisiting the classic studies (about Sherif &amp; Sherif’s summer camp study) Chapter 10 in Social Psychology: Revisiting the classic studies (about Tajfel’s minimal group studies - best read after class) After you have read about Tajfel’s minimal group experiments (e.g., this Chapter 10), have a look at a recent paper that makes some important points regarding the limits and the interpretation of these findings: (Sand 2020) 2.3 Additions after the live session To think about how to deal with our own subtle prejudices and tendencies to discriminate, June Sarpong’s thoughts on six degrees of integration are interesting The availability heuristic is described well in Daniel Kahneman’s book Thinking fast and slow. We will be revisiting the main ideas from that in "],
["social-influence-behaviour-in-groups.html", "Lecture 3 Social influence: behaviour in groups 3.1 Video lecture for this week 3.2 Preparation before class 3.3 Recommended readings", " Lecture 3 Social influence: behaviour in groups We spend much of our lives in groups - be they groups of friends hanging out, teams trying to achieve a common purpose or protestors working to bring about change. Often, our individual behaviour is powerfully shaped by the presence of others. This week, we will explore when that happens, and how groups can enhance rather than impede both performance and moral behaviour. 3.1 Video lecture for this week This week’s lecture is split into five parts, that you should watch in order (if you run out of time or patience, the fifth part is optional). In between, there are a couple of questions that will allow you to reflect on the content and make sure you have understood the main points. You can download the lecture slides here. 3.1.1 Social facilitation &amp; social loafing Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions: According to the social facilitation effect, how does the presence of others affect one’s performance? It improves performance It decreases performance Can be either - strengthens the ‘dominant’ response Think back to a time when you successfully completed a group project. Was there any social loafing going on? If so, how did you deal with it? If not, what do you think prevented it? 3.1.2 Deindividuation Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions: Can you explain the social identity account of deindividuation? Can you think of a personal example where deindividuation led to you behaving in a way that was strongly in line with group norms? In Diener’s (1976) trick or treat experiment, the experimenters manipulated whether or not participants were anonymous. They just observed whether participants arrived alone or in groups. Which of their two main conclusions is based on better evidence, based on that design? Anonymity increases transgressions Being in a group increases transgression No difference (If you are not confident in your answer, please make sure to bring this up in class.) 3.1.3 Group behaviours Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions: What effect are online ‘echo chambers’ most closely related to? Group convergence Group polarisation Groupthink Can you think of any situations - in your personal life or in history - when groupthink led to a wrong decision being taken? If you were involved in that decision making process (again), what steps would you take to prevent groupthink? A controversial application of the ideas of group convergence and group polarisation comes from the “costly signaling” explanation for religious beliefs and behaviours. If you are curious about that, have a look at the section on Wikipedia. Then consider whether you find the idea convincing (based on that very limited knowledge about the research evidence) and how it relates to the concepts we have discussed so far. 3.1.4 Social influence Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions: Let’s briefly think about antisemitism and the holocaust. What is going on in the following situations, and what kind of institutional or educational interventions could reduce the likelihood of that type of behaviour? someone hears throughout their life that Jews are bad and dangerous, comes to share that belief and joins in the destruction of Jewish shops etc: Conformity Compliance Obedience a guard in a concentration camp send Jews to the gas chambers because they have been given the order to do so: Conformity Compliance Obedience someone stops seeing their Jewish friend because they do not want to face any disapproval from their (much larger) group of German friends: Conformity Compliance Obedience 3.1.5 Bonus: Milgram’s shock machine experiments Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following question: Do you believe you would have gone all the way up to 450V if you had participated in the experiment? How confident are you in your answer? If you think you would have resisted, what strategies would you have employed? 3.2 Preparation before class Make sure to watch the videos and engage with the questions. This week, in particular, you should be able to connect all the theoretical concepts to your own life experiences, which can make them more memorable and likely also help you in life beyond this module. 3.3 Recommended readings Textbook: Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 in Principles of Social Psychology Chapter 7 in Social Psychology: Revisiting the classic studies (and chapter 5 and 6, if you have time). Additionally, you can read Chapter 8 in Humankind, especially if you are considering writing the essay on Milgram. Review article on how to create social norms that promote pro-environmental behaviour (Cialdini 2003). Beyond that particular issue, this shows how social influence can be used for good. "],
["altruism-close-relationships.html", "Lecture 4 Altruism // close relationships 4.1 Video lecture for this week 4.2 Recommended readings", " Lecture 4 Altruism // close relationships This week, we are looking at two separate but related topics - altruism and close relationship. With regard to altruism, we are often told that people are out to look for their self-interest, yet we can witness (apparently) self-less helping everyday. We will consider why that is, and how altruistic (or “pro-social”) behaviour can be promoted. Additionally, starting from the fact that (positive) close relationships have been shown to provide a huge boost to health and well-being, we will consider how they emerge. As part of that, we will consider how people select their (potential) romantic partners and discuss the broader social consequences of individual preferences. 4.1 Video lecture for this week This week’s lecture is split into four parts, that you should watch in order. In between, there are a couple of questions and tasks that will allow you to reflect on the content and explore the topic further. Make sure to answer the content questions before you move on - when you do the extension activites is obviously up to you. You can download the lecture slides here 4.1.1 Self-interest and altruism Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions: How would you use evolutionary, social exchange and empathy-based explanations of prosocial behaviour to explain in-group bias, i.e. the fact that people provide more help to members of their own social groups? What is known as the bystander effect? Often, individuals help less when there are many other potential helpers around Bystanders intervened in 90% of observed public conflicts Competing priorities - such as being in a hurry - reduce the likelihood of helping (Note that all statements are true.) I would also encourage you to experiment with the impact of prosocial thoughts and behaviours on your own well-being. Usually, I would focus on getting you to perform random acts of kindness, but in Covid-times, loving-kindness meditation is an alternative that is contact-free. Have a look at the following and decide when you want to give either a go: A list of ideas for random acts of kindness (not limited to the Random Acts of Kindness day, but not all are Covid-secure) A guided loving-kindness mediation. It might sound esoteric, but give it a go (or search Google Scholar to find the evidence behind it) 4.1.2 Predictors of liking and attraction Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions: What is homophily? A preference for same-sex partners The tendency to marry in-group members The tendency to prefer friends and potential partners who are similar to oneself Which of the following might explain why we like music better when we have heard it before? Reciprocity Mere exposure Personal preferences 4.1.3 Beauty - Myths &amp; Debates Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions: Think about the possible explanations for why we care about beauty: evolutionary processes, meaningful signals about personality, cues of conformity. Which do you think most explains your preferences? Which is most relevant across society? Have a look at Dove’s #MyBeautyMySay ad on Youtube. How does that relate to what I said about beauty? Why would a brand advertise like that? What is your personal reaction to the ad? 4.1.4 Maintaining close relationships Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions: How would you explain the findings that social connections - and especially stable romantic relationships - are associated with sharply reduced mortality? If you want to find out more about that, you can have a look at this article on the brilliant Behind the headlines site created by the NHS that explains the science behind headlines What are the key elements of love, according to Sternberg’s triangular theory? Liking, Exposure, Similarity Intimacy, Passion, Commitment Values, Trust, Empathy 4.2 Recommended readings Textbook: Chapter 9 on altruism and Chapter 8 on liking and loving in Principles of Social Psychology. You can also have a look at Chapter 13 that discusses how people balance self-interest and concern for others. Chapter 12 in Social Psychology: Revisiting the classic studies and/or Chapter 9 in Humankind Review article on the costs and benefits of selfishness and ‘otherishness’ (Crocker, Canevello, and Brown 2017) that explores a wide range of factors that help explain when people behave selfishly or otherwise, and what the consequences of those behaviours are. Journal article: especially if you are considering writing your essay on attachment, have a look at Girme’s recent article on modeling non-linear relationships in this area (Girme 2020). It is a bit complicated to read, but highlights a very common issue in psychological research (an excessive focus on linear relationships) and presents some novel findings. "],
["critiquing-social-psychology-and-understanding-the-replication-crisis.html", "Lecture 5 Critiquing social psychology and understanding the replication crisis 5.1 Video lecture for this week 5.2 Preparation before class 5.3 Recommended readings", " Lecture 5 Critiquing social psychology and understanding the replication crisis Fueled by concerns about the reliability of psychological research, a large scale project in 2015 (Open 2015) attempted to replicate some major findings in the field. The results were a shock for many people - especially in social psychology, only a minority of findings were confirmed in replication studies. Since then, there has been a debate about why so many findings are not replicated, and what can be done about that. We will be discussing how social psychology research can be made more robust. In addition, we will consider more fundamental critiques of the way most research in social psychology is done and consider the case for using qualitative research methods. Finally, we will look at the attitude-behaviour links and consider how a focus on studying only attitudes might impoverish our conclusions. 5.1 Video lecture for this week You can download the slides for this week’s lectures here - maybe download them now to follow along, there is quite a bit of text on some of them. 5.1.1 Qualitative critiques of social psychology Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions: Which of the following is not a critical challenge to quantitative social psychology? There is no objective reality, instead we construct it collectively through language There is no place for a neutral observer - we are always embedded in relationships We should follow the scientific method and use accurate measures We need to check our assumption that problems are located in the individual What are WEIRD samples in psychology? When do you think we should worry about them? When do you think they are sufficient? 5.1.2 Replication crisis NOTE: The sound quality issue with this video should now be fixed. If you tried to watch it before Tuesday afternoon, please give it another go. Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions: The Reproducibility Project repeated 100 important studies that had reported significant results. Out of the social psychology studies, what share of replications yielded significant results? 10% 25% 50% 80% What are Type I errors? False positives False negatives Are they always a sign of mistakes/problems with the research process? TRUE FALSE Click to read more Don’t worry about remembering what Type I and Type II errors are (at least for this module), but make sure that you understand the difference between false positives and false negatives. Also, these errors are not always a sign of problems with the research process. Statistics is about quantifying the probability that a trend we observe in a sample tells us something real about a broader population - we then need to decide which belief to adopt, and will inevitable be wrong at times. However, having many more errors in the literature than expected is a problem, and too many failed replications are a definitive sign of that. Have a look at this tool for p-hacking. How might something similar happen in social psychology? Do you understand why this invalidates p-values? Otherwise, make sure to raise this in class. 5.1.3 Attitude-behaviour links Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions: How would you explain the relationship between attitudes and behaviours, having watched the video? What does that mean for interpreting survey studies that measure attitudes? What was the main finding in LaPiere’s 1934 study about attitudes and behaviours? Discriminatory attitudes were more widespread than discriminatory behaviours Discriminatory behaviours were more widespread than discriminatory attitudes Discriminatory attitudes predicted discriminatory behaviours well How would you explain that finding? Have a look at the Parable of Polygons. Do you find any of it surprising? Can you think of any sphere in your personal life where a similar effect is visible? 5.2 Preparation before class I’d encourage you to give the multiple choice exam - available from Tuesday on Moodle - a first go and bring your questions to class. 5.3 Recommended readings The seminal 2015 article by the Open Science Collaboration. It can be freely downloaded here and has a 1-page summary that you should read at the very least. The article in the BPS Research Digest on 10 famous psychology findings that its been difficult to replicate Wikipedia entry on the replication crisis. It gives a good overview over the issue in various disciplines and the various responses that have been proposed. A very new (short) article on “What is replication?” (Nosek and Errington 2020) - it shows quite nicely how replications can be not just a clean-up exercise but an important contribution to scientific progress. If you are curious about the start of the replication debate, you might want to read the article that kicked it all off: “Feeling the future” (Bem 2011) that provided experimental evidence for our ability to, well, feel the future before it happened. It’s not essential reading; if you read it, think about what had to go wrong for this to get published in an influential journal. "],

["cognitive-biases.html", "Seminar 4 Cognitive biases D.1 Seminar materials D.2 Recommended readings and further resources", " Seminar 4 Cognitive biases In this seminar, we further discussed the lecture content, especially around the identifiable victim effect. We also discussed why you estimated, on average, to be more trustworthy than 66% of St Mary’s psychology students - three explanations might be worth keeping considering: We overestimate our positive attributes as that makes us feel good (the general Optimism Bias). We have an excessively pessimistic perception of others, having been trained to accept a negative view of humans (the Humankind argument). People are most prone to overestimate their relative performance/skill when they are bad at something - the so called Dunning-Kruger effect. We then discussed the example of Linda - see slides - and I highlighted the importance of avoiding the Conjunction Fallacy, i.e. of recognising that a more specific criterion is always less likely to apply. Then we talked about Covid mass-testing ideas to explore the importance of considering base rates. Wikipedia has a clear example of that here. Given that there are many more accountants than investigative journalists, this is important to the Linda example as well. If you have time for some further reading, have a look at the paper by Schleifer below - it discusses the Linda example further (split into 2, once called Steve with regard to base rates, and then Linda only with regard to the conjunction).
