# Revision

*NB:* This seminar was initially meant to cover referencing as well - don't worry, we will get there in the next few weeks, proper revision seemed more important.  

## Seminar materials

You can download the revision slides <a href="./files/Seminar_5_-_revision.pptx">here</a>. If you go through them properly and ensure that you understand all the concepts, you will be in a rather good shape for the multiple choice exam and future social psychology modules.
