# Altruism // close relationships

This week, we are looking at two separate but related topics - altruism and close relationship. With regard
to altruism, we are often told that people are out to look for their self-interest, yet we can witness (apparently)
self-less helping everyday. We will consider why that is, and how altruistic (or "pro-social") behaviour can be promoted.

Additionally, starting from the fact that (positive) close relationships have been shown to provide a huge boost to 
health and well-being, we will consider how they emerge. As part of that, we will consider how people select their 
(potential) romantic partners and discuss the broader social consequences of individual preferences.

* Journal article: especially if you are considering writing your essay on attachment, have a look at Girme's recent article on modeling non-linear relationships in this area [@open2015psychology]. It is a bit complicated to read, but highlights a very common issue in psychological research (an excessive focus on linear relationships) and presents some novel findings.
