# Altruism // close relationships

This week, we are looking at two separate but related topics - altruism and close relationship. With regard
to altruism, we are often told that people are out to look for their self-interest, yet we can witness (apparently)
self-less helping everyday. We will consider why that is, and how altruistic (or "pro-social") behaviour can be promoted.

Additionally, starting from the fact that (positive) close relationships have been shown to provide a huge boost to 
health and well-being, we will consider how they emerge. As part of that, we will consider how people select their 
(potential) romantic partners and discuss the broader social consequences of individual preferences.

## Video lecture for this week

This week's lecture is split into four parts, that you should watch in order. In between, there are a couple of questions and tasks that will allow you to reflect on the content and explore the topic further. Make sure to answer the content questions before you move on - when you do the extension activites is obviously up to you.

You can download the lecture slides <a href="./files/Lecture_4_-_altruism_and_attraction.pptx">here</a>

### Self-interest and altruism

Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions:

- How would you use evolutionary, social exchange and empathy-based explanations of prosocial behaviour to explain in-group bias, i.e. the fact that people provide more help to members of their own social groups?
- What is known as the bystander effect? <select class='solveme' data-answer='["Often, individuals help less when there are many other potential helpers around"]'> <option></option> <option>Often, individuals help less when there are many other potential helpers around</option> <option>Bystanders intervened in 90% of observed public conflicts</option> <option>Competing priorities - such as being in a hurry - reduce the likelihood of helping</option></select> (Note that all statements are true.)

I would also encourage you to experiment with the impact of prosocial thoughts and behaviours on your own well-being. Usually, I would focus on getting you to perform random acts of kindness, but in Covid-times, loving-kindness meditation is an alternative that is contact-free. Have a look at the following and decide when you want to give either a go:

- A list of ideas for [random acts of kindness](https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/the-kindness-blog/2943-50-kindness-ideas-for-random-acts-of-kindness-day){target="_blank"} (not limited to the Random Acts of Kindness day, but not all are Covid-secure)
- A [guided loving-kindness mediation](https://youtu.be/sz7cpV7ERsM){target="_blank"}. It might sound esoteric, but give it a go (or search Google Scholar to find the evidence behind it)

Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions:

### Beauty - Myths & Debates

Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions:

- Think about the possible explanations for why we care about beauty: evolutionary processes, meaningful signals about personality, cues of conformity. Which do you think most explains *your* preferences? Which is most relevant across society?
- Have a look at Dove's #MyBeautyMySay ad on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/_XOa7zVqxA4){target="_blank"}. How does that relate to what I said about beauty? Why would a brand advertise like that? What is your personal reaction to the ad?

Before you move on, take a moment to reflect on the content of the video and answer the following questions:

- How would you explain the findings that social connections - and especially stable romantic relationships - are associated with sharply reduced mortality? If you want to find out more about that, you can have a look at [this article](https://www.nhs.uk/news/mental-health/loneliness-increases-risk-of-premature-death/){target="_blank"} on the brilliant *Behind the headlines* site created by the NHS that explains the science behind headlines

## Recommended readings

* Textbook: [Chapter 9 on altruism](https://open.lib.umn.edu/socialpsychology/part/chapter-9-helping-and-altruism/){target="_blank"} and [Chapter 8 on liking and loving](https://open.lib.umn.edu/socialpsychology/part/chapter-8-liking-and-loving/){target="_blank"} in *Principles of Social Psychology*. 
You can also have a look at [Chapter 13](https://open.lib.umn.edu/socialpsychology/part/chapter-13-competition-and-cooperation-in-our-social-worlds/){target="_blank"} that discusses how people balance self-interest and concern for others.
* Chapter 12 in **Social Psychology: Revisiting the classic studies** and/or Chapter 9 in **Humankind**
* Review article on the costs and benefits of selfishness and 'otherishness' [@crocker2017social] that explores a wide range of factors that help explain when people behave selfishly or otherwise, and what the consequences of those behaviours are.
* Journal article: especially if you are considering writing your essay on attachment, have a look at Girme's recent article on modeling non-linear relationships in this area [@girme2020step]. It is a bit complicated to read, but highlights a very common issue in psychological research (an excessive focus on linear relationships) and presents some novel findings.
